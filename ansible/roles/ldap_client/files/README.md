# LDAP groups and users

copy ldap_users.csv.in  -> ldap_users.csv
copy ldap_groups.csv.in -> ldap_groups.csv

and change the contents accordingly to make initial set of users and groups.

A few lines are written in the above files to give you ideas about what to write in them, but make sure you remove them except for the first line (header).

The password column of ldap_users.csv is the plain password.
The password_hash column of ldap_users.csv is the hash of the password, generated by 

slappasswd -s PLAIN_PASSWORD

If you put password_hash column, password column is ignored, so you can leave them empty.

If you do not have slappaswd command, fill password column and leave the password_hash column empty.
